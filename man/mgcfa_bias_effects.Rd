\usage{
mgcfa_bias_effects(
  x,
  steps = NULL,
  groups = NULL,
  composites = NULL,
  include_items = TRUE,
  include_class_decomposition = TRUE,
  digits = 3L,
  rounding = c("signif", "round", "none")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object returned by \code{mgcfa_auto()}.}

\item{steps}{Optional character vector of recovered steps to summarize.
Defaults to all steps with both failed non-partial and selected recovered
models.}

\item{groups}{Optional length-2 vector indicating reference and focal groups
(labels or indices). Defaults to the first two groups.}

\item{composites}{Optional named list defining observed composites. Each
element may be (a) a character vector of observed variable names (equal
weights) or (b) a named numeric vector of weights.}

\item{include_items}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, include one-item composites for
each observed indicator.}

\item{include_class_decomposition}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, also estimates
class-specific bias effects by refitting the failed model with only the
freed terms from each parameter class.}

\item{digits}{Number of digits used for numeric formatting.}

\item{rounding}{Numeric rounding mode. One of \code{"signif"},
\code{"round"}, or \code{"none"}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"mgcfa_bias_effects"} containing summary
tables for observed and latent bias effects.
}
\description{
Produces signed bias-effect contrasts (dMACS-style deltas) by comparing the
failed non-partial model at each recovered step to the selected bias-adjusted
model. Supports observed item/composite outcomes and latent mean/SD
comparisons, with optional decomposition by freed parameter class.
